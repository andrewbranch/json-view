# JSONView

A simple JSON viewer with ~~basic~~ no edit capabilities. It has styles similar to Chrome's dev tools, so it's perfect for building dev tools extensions... **[live example](https://richard-livingston.github.io/json-view/)**.

My fork removes editing capabilities, has no dependencies, and is an ES module.
